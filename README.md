# Page Structure:

- Home / Intro section, with nice typing animation
- About section with infos about me
- Services tab, outlining the things I do / offer
  - Service stats counter
- Work list, showing everything ive done so far thats noteworthy
- Contact field

Page design as seen on various public portfolios, some ideas from templates and google images. Goal was to keep it simple while still showing my skills, and ofc listing everything I do / have done that is worthy a mention.
