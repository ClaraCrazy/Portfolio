# üì∞ Page Structure:

- Home / Intro section, with nice typing animation
- About section with infos about me
- Services tab, outlining the things I do / offer
  - Service stats counter
- Work list, showing everything ive done so far thats noteworthy
- Contact field

Page design as seen on various public portfolios, some ideas from templates and google images. Goal was to keep it simple while still showing my skills, and ofc listing everything I do / have done that is worthy a mention.

- Loose files:
  - LICENSE, the License for this repository
  - README.md, *this*
  - index.html, the Website Core

<p>Since I work full-time on open-source projects like <a href="https://github.com/Flipper-XFW/Xtreme-Firmware">Xtreme</a>, My only source of income is donations from people like you that use & appreciate my stuff. So, if you can spare a dollar or two, I would really appreciate that. All the money goes towards paying rent, essentials like food, drinks etc, and most importantly it will be used to fuel my cookie addictionüç™<br></p>
